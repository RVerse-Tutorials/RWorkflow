These are a collection of short sessions (45min to 1hr) from RWorkflow workshops that I have given 2018-2021. The sessions are focused on tools and practices for scientists to help you be **faster, more efficient and organized** in your coding and in merging reports with code. The focus of these workshops is practical skills and tools. Each session is stand-alone. The sessions are generally introductory with links to GitHub repositories that illustrate more complex examples (and that you can copy and build on).

**Target audience**: You already code in R, maybe use RStudio too, but want to learn some tips about being more efficient from a seasoned R programmer who does the kind of coding and work that you do.

**About me**: I am a modeler/applied mathematician with the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) and I am immersed in R. I develop R packages for public use. I teach time-series analysis at the University of Washington (using R) and I teach workshops on R and reproducible research.
